A dynamic website for a real estate in Ethiopia.

Real Estate Website
Hey there! This is a real estate website I’ve been working on. It’s pretty straightforward, with a mix of static pages and a dynamic news section. One cool thing is that it supports both English and Amharic, so it’s perfect for a wider audience.

What you’ll find:
Home Page: A welcoming space with some info about what we do.
Our Apartments: A gallery-style page showing off the apartments with descriptions and photos.
News Page: This is where things get interesting! We post updates on the real estate world with photos and videos to keep it engaging.
About Us: A little background on who we are and what we’re all about.
Contact Us: A simple form for anyone looking to get in touch.

It’s been a fun project, especially with the challenge of adding bilingual support and making sure everything flows smoothly. Feel free to check it out, and let me know what you think!
